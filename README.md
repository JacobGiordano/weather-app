# weather-app

A weather app that uses data from the [OpenWeatherMap.org API] (https://home.openweathermap.org/) to display weather for a given city. All animated icons were created by [Bas Miliys] (https://basmilius.github.io/weather-icons/). Check out the [live demo here] (https://jacobgiordano.github.io/weather-station/).
